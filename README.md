# RITU

This project comprises a web application designed to promote environmental awareness among ordinary citizens. The web app, with its frontend developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and backend developed using Django connected to an SQLite3 database, enables users to compete against each other in completing tasks designed to help fight climate change, e.g - plant a tree, replace filament bulb with energy-saving bulb, recycle plastic bottles. Our goal was that if we give ordinary citizens a competitive incentive to act sustainably, then we could generate greater environmental awareness.

I have worked on this project with my teammates Absara Chowdhury, and Farhan Ishrak Tahmid.

This project was completed for my university course CSE311: Database Management Systems.
